### Acknowledgements
* I done the old "Go Humongous With MongoDB Atlas" mini project and didnt really understand alot of it as things didnt work and I was constanly on tutor support 
getting help, So I decided to do the mile-stone project by watching the new videos and lessons to get a better understanding 
* I started here:
 https://courses.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+DCP101+2017_T3/courseware/196c000dd670458cafc7b2dc9d4a8245/016a25dab553425ba26288263c0c3a6e/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3ACodeInstitute%2BDCP101%2B2017_T3%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%40016a25dab553425ba26288263c0c3a6e
* And followed the rest of the course but changing it to make it my own and look the way I wanted it to
