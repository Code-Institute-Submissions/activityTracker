## Technologies
* I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this project


## Testing
* At the start I had some bugs like for example the images not showwing on the deployed version but showing on Gitpod, I later found out that was down to having the absolute path put in once I removed the "../" it worked fine.
* I tested the colour scheme here: https://coolors.co/
* I tested the JavaScript here: https://jshint.com/
* Below is the results of the HTML test
